# SoChannelScape

List a number of social media (Youtube) channels, their style, their inclination from a place of understanding to a political stance and their audience growth.

This project comes from a need to analyse and set down where do the idea we consume come from and how to overcome the gap that can divide us humans in that social landspace.

Political content (sides) makes the world move. Philosophical content (middle) looks for the direction.
